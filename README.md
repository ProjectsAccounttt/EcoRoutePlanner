# Copilot AI Developer Program Project: EcoRoute Planner – AI-Powered Sustainable Travel Assistant

## Inspiration
Transportation accounts for nearly 30% of global CO₂ emissions, with personal vehicles being major contributors. While many want to reduce their carbon footprint, calculating the true environmental impact of travel options remains complex. 

EcoRoute Planner was born from the need for an intelligent system that makes sustainable travel planning effortless. Our solution leverages Copilot AI to transform how individuals and businesses evaluate transportation choices by providing real-time, personalized emissions analysis.

## What It Does
EcoRoute Planner is a comprehensive sustainability assistant that:

🌱 **Core Features**
- Calculates precise route distances using multiple transportation modes
- Generates real-time CO₂ estimates based on vehicle specifications and traffic conditions
- Maintains personalized vehicle profiles (ICE, hybrid, EV) for accurate calculations
- Provides multimodal comparisons (driving vs. flying vs. rail)
- Offers AI-curated eco-routing suggestions

📊 **Advanced Capabilities**
- Adaptive learning based on user travel patterns
- Fleet management insights for businesses
- Carbon budget tracking with M365 integration
- Educational breakdowns of emission factors
